# AI Landing Zone Patterns

Reference architectures and deployment patterns for enterprise Azure AI workloads.

## Two Reference Architectures

| Architecture      | When to use                                                                              |
| ----------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| AI LZ for Foundry | Direct AI Apps & Agents workloads using Foundry; single team or business unit            |
| AI LZ for APIM    | Centralized AI gateway for multiple teams; cross-team token governance; cost attribution |
| Both (combined)   | Enterprise platform — Foundry for individual workloads, APIM for central governance      |

> The two architectures are complementary. Start with AI LZ for Foundry for a single
> team; add AI LZ for APIM when a second team onboards or when cost attribution is required.

## Deployment Patterns

### Greenfield (Standalone with New Resources)

- Provisions a new VNet, new Log Analytics workspace, and all AI resources from scratch
- Use when: no existing Azure Landing Zone or CAF Enterprise-Scale platform
- All networking, DNS, and firewall are self-contained in the AI LZ

### Brownfield (Standalone with Existing Resources)

- Integrates with existing enterprise LZ — reuses central VNet, firewall, DNS zones, and monitoring
- Use when: a CAF/Enterprise-Scale platform landing zone is already in place
- The AI LZ delegates to shared services (DNS, firewall, monitoring) via platform team hand-off

**Key question to ask in requirements:** "Does the customer have an existing Azure Landing Zone?"

If YES → brownfield pattern; identify which shared services the AI LZ will reuse.
If NO → greenfield pattern; the AI LZ must provision all networking dependencies.

## Resource Organization

| Decision                       | Recommendation                                                  | Source   |
| ------------------------------ | --------------------------------------------------------------- | -------- |
| How many AI Services accounts? | One per billing boundary (per team, BU, or environment)         | R-R4     |
| How many Foundry Projects?     | One per distinct application or use case                        | R-R4     |
| Storage isolation              | Separate Cosmos DB + blob storage + AI Search index per Project | D-R2     |
| Environment separation         | Separate AI Services accounts for dev / staging / prod          | Security |

## Pre-Deployment Quota Checks

Always verify before deploying (source: AI-LZ R-R2, R-R3):

1. **TPM quota** for the target model in the target region
   - Check: Azure Portal → AI Services → Quota → Global Standard or Provisioned
   - Or: `az cognitiveservices usage list --location <region>`
2. **PTU availability** if using provisioned throughput
   - PTU capacity is reserved per region; verify availability before committing
3. **AI Search limits** in target region
   - Partition and replica limits vary by region and tier
4. **Cognitive Services account limit** per subscription (default: 15 per region for S0)
   - Request increase if deploying per-team accounts across many teams

**Regions with Azure OpenAI Evaluation support** (required for Foundry eval runs):
`eastus2`, `northcentralus`, `swedencentral`, `switzerlandwest`, `uaenorth`

> Default APEX region `swedencentral` supports Azure OpenAI Evaluation. ✓

## Region Selection

| Service                         | Availability constraint                                       | Source |
| ------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------- | ------ |
| Azure OpenAI model availability | Not all models available in all regions; check model cards    | R-R1   |
| AI Foundry Evaluation           | Limited regions (see above)                                   | R-R1   |
| PTU capacity                    | PTU reservations are region-specific; pre-check before deploy | R-R2   |
| Content Safety                  | Available in most regions; verify for swedencentral           | R-R1   |

When requirements specify a model (e.g., `o1`, `gpt-4.5`), verify it is available in
`swedencentral` before proceeding. Fallback regions: `eastus2` or `northcentralus`.

## IaC Implementation

Bicep and Terraform implementations of the AI Landing Zone patterns:

- Repository: https://github.com/Azure/AI-Landing-Zones
- Both use AVM (Azure Verified Modules) as the module source
- Bicep: `br/public:avm/res/` module paths
- Terraform: `registry.terraform.io/Azure/avm-res-` module paths
